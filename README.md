This repository will hold my submission for project 2 on the Programming for Data Analysis module. This module forms part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics) at Atlantic Technological University, Galway. The code was written using Python 3.9.7 in the Anaconda distribution (available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)). It will require the following packages:

* [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html)

This submission will consist of a Jupyter notebook that will examine the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and some of the machine learning algorithms applied to it. My intention is to carry out the project in three stages as follows:

## Research

* Carried out using ATU library and online journals
* Research the dataset, its history and use in machine learning models
* Identify four suitable classifiers to study through the literature review

## Investigate

* Carried out using Jupyter notebook
* Carry out exploratory data analysis and generate a set of descriptive statistics for the dataset
* Plot various attributes to get an understanding of the shape of the data and any particular aspects worthy of further investigation
* Identify four suitable machine learning algorithms to use to train and then test ML models.


## Analyse

* Carried out in Jupyter notebook
* Compare the results of my ML models to the classifiers reviewed in the research stage
* Identify any differences from documented trials and consider possible root causes
* Examine the distribution of data for each attribute to identify the optimum way of generating synthetic data
* Discuss how to generate a synthetic dataset for use in training further models
